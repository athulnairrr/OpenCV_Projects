# Clothes_Customizer
This is a website which makes use of 3js to showcase a shirt on which you can easily upload your own logo or add the image to the whole shirt.
This project is still in progress as i want to integrate the color picker 

1. ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
2. React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
3. TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
4. Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

Also i want to link it to the dalle OpenAPI to be able to prompt and use the images for the shirt.
